	 * 	2) As with any recursive algorithm, each recursive call takes up
	 * some space on the stack. And, if we have enough of those recursive calls,
	 * the stack will eventually blow up throwing a StackOverflowException. And
	 * this is precisely what happens with our second method when we use values
	 * over 10000
